Image manifolds offer a perceptually meaningful model to organize images for
certain types of natural image sets. However, unsupervised methods are limited in the
situations where a discriminant factor needs to be recovered from an image set with
multiple latent factors of variation. Meanwhile, supervised manifold learning 
approaches incorporate image labels that provide additional constraints to the relationships between
images and can be robust against irrelevant factors. During the course of my PhD 
study, I was very interested in learning on image manifolds with weak supervision, 
which needs much less manual labeling effort than supervised methods. 
My work considered three variants of weakly supervised learning on image manifolds, 
when image labels do not explain all the latent factors of image variation, 
or are only partly available or highly corrupted.
