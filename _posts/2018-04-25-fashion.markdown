### Overview

We proposed a novel type of _dialog agent_ for the task of _interactive image retrieval_. 
Recently, there has been a rapid rise of research interest in visually grounded conversational 
agents, driven by the progress of deep learning techniques for both image and natural 
language understanding. A few interesting application scenarios have been explored by 
recent work, such as collaborative drawing, visual dialog and object guessing game. 
In this work, we tested the value of visually grounded dialog agents in a practical and yet
challenging context. Specicially, we proposed a novel framework of image retrieval system which learns to seek 
natural and expressive dialog feedbacks from the user and iteratively refine the retrieval result.

### Goal-oriented Training of Dialog Manager
When designing an interactive image retrieval system, deciding on which images to return to the users
at each interaction round and how to aggregate the user feedback in a principled way are the essential 
problems to be addressed. The desired behavior of the retrieval system is to learn how to construct 
the optimal sequence of candidate images to obtain the most informative user feedbacks. 
Instead of specifying the rules for candidate image selection and feedback
aggregation, we let the retrieval system (which we call _dialog manager_) automatically learn to 
optimize the retrieval objective, which is the ranking percentile of the target image. To the best of our knowledge, 
this is the first time goal-oriented training being applied to the context of interactive image retrieval.

Below is the network architecture for our dialog manager, which consists of (1) a response encoder that
combines the candidate image from the previous round and the natural language feedback, (2) a history encoder
for aggregating the new evidence and the dialog history and (3) a candidate image selector, which is simply
stochastic kNN during training and 1-NN during testing.

### User Simulator using Relative Captioning 
One challenge remains in order to train the dialog management in a goal-oriended, end-to-end fashion: 
how do we obtain user feedbacks? The natural approach is to train the dialog manager in an online way
with human annotator in the loop. However, this procedure could be prohibitively slow and expensive.
it takes about one minute to collect one round of user interactions, if we need 120k set of training data, then 2k hours of annotation work needs to be collected. 

We therefore devised a new vision task: relative image captioning, which aims to serve as a proxy of human annotators and helps to train the dialog agent. The idea is simple: given a pair of images, how do humans describe their visual differences in natural language. To this end, we collected a dataset for relative image captioning (which will be released) and trained a show-attend-tell based captioning generator. See below for generated image captions:

### Code and Dataset 

We are working on details of code and data release and will give an update soon. 

In the mean while, please see a video demo of an user interacting with the dialog agent:
