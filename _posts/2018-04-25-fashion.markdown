We proposed a novel type of __dialog agent__ for the task of __interactive image retrieval__. 
Recently, there has been a rapid rise of research interest in visually grounded conversational 
agents, driven by the progress of deep learning architectures for both image and natural 
language understand problems. While interesting attempts have demonstrated the multitudes 
of potential application values of visually grounded conversational agents in applications 
such as collabative drawing, visual dialog and object guessing game. In this work, we focus on 
addressing interactive image retrieval problems by allowing the user to interact via 
expressive, free-form dialogs.
