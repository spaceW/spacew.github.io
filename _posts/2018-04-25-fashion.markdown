We proposed a novel type of _dialog agent_ for the task of _interactive image retrieval_. 
Recently, there has been a rapid rise of research interest in visually grounded conversational 
agents, driven by the progress of deep learning techniques for both image and natural 
language understanding. A few interesting application scenarios have been explored by 
recent work, such as collaborative drawing, visual dialog and object guessing game. 
In this work, we tested the value of visually grounded dialog agents in a practical and yet
challenging context. Specicially, we proposed a novel framework of image retrieval system which learns to seek 
expressive, free-form dialog feedback from the user and iteratively refine the retrieval result.
