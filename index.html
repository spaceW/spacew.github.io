        <h1 class="top-text">About Hui Wu</h1>
        <p>I am a computer vision scientist at <a href=https://www.research.ibm.com/ai/>IBM Research AI</a>, 
            currently focused on understanding 
            and developing deep learning algorithms for real-world applications such as 
            <a href=https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/visual-recognition/></a>visual 
            recognition and fashion design. Beyond my work in computer vision, I am also interested 
            in how the research on human intelligence and machine intelligence can learn from each 
            other, and how we can develop beneficial and responsible AI tools to better our future.</p>

        <p>Prior to IBM, I received my PhD in Computer Science from <a href=https://www.uncc.edu/>UNC Charlotte</a>, 
        where I worked with <a href=https://cis.temple.edu/~souvenir/>Dr. Richard Souvenir</a>
       (2011-2015) on the subject of manifold learning based machine learning techniques 
        and their applications in computer vision and medical image analysis. </p>
