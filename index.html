        <p>
            I am a computer vision researcher at <a href=https://www.research.ibm.com/ai/>IBM Research AI</a>. 
            I work on learning and developing machine learning and computer vision algorithms 
            for real-world applications. Beyond my work on computer vision research, 
            I like to think about what intelligent tools we can build to better argument human 
            capability and productivity. 
</p>

        <p>Prior to joining IBM, I received my PhD in Computer Science from <a href=https://www.uncc.edu/>UNC Charlotte</a>. 
       There I worked with my thesis advisor <a href=https://cis.temple.edu/~souvenir/>Dr. Richard Souvenir</a> (2011-2015) 
       on applying manifold learning based machine learning techniques to computer vision problems, with a focus on echcardiogram 
       video analysis.</p>
