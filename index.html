        <h1 class="top-text">About Hui Wu</h1>
        <p>I am a computer vision scientist at <a href=https://www.research.ibm.com/ai/>IBM Research AI</a>, 
            currently focused on understanding 
            and developing deep learning algorithms for real-world applications such as 
            <a href=https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/visual-recognition/></a>visual 
            recognition and fashion design. Beyond my work in computer vision, I am also interested 
            in how the research on human intelligence and machine intelligence can learn from each 
            other, and how we can develop beneficial and responsible AI tools to better our future.</p>

        <p>Prior to IBM, I received my PhD in Computer Science from <a href=https://www.uncc.edu/>UNC Charlotte</a>, 
        where I worked with <a href=https://cis.temple.edu/~souvenir/>Dr. Richard Souvenir</a>
       (2011-2015) on the subject of manifold learning based machine learning techniques 
        and their applications in computer vision and medical image analysis. </p>
        
        <p>I designed this theme from the ground up for <a href=http://www.ezrasavard.com>my own website</a> and had some inspiration from the <a href=http://the-development.github.io/flex/>Flex Jekyll Theme</a> (fonts!) and <a href=http://lisesavard.com/>Lise Savard's Blog</a>.</p>
        <p>Ezora uses a fairly minimal set of layouts and sass, and will automatically conform to a sensible layout based on the YAML provided, unless a layout is specified. Width/height values are all defined in the top of main.scss as variables, so you don't have to hunt too far through the SCSS to tweak things.</p>
        <p>The default layout handles the home page and any other pages while the post layout extends the default slightly to include a date-stamp at the top of the page.</p>
        <p>Notable _includes are the shiny and responsive topbar, included in the default layout, and the postlist, which is a paginated pile of posts you can include in any page, like the default home page does. You can specify your navigation menu links in topbar.</p>
