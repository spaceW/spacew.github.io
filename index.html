        <p>
            I am a computer vision researcher in the <a href=https://www.research.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence/computer-vision/>
            computer vision and multimedia group</a> at <a href=https://www.research.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence/>IBM Research AI</a>,
            My current research interest includes vision and language, interactive image retrieval, multi-modal dialogs and computer vision for fashion. Prior to joining IBM, I received my PhD in Computer Science from <a href=https://www.uncc.edu/>UNC Charlotte</a>, with a thesis focus on manifold learning based machine learning techniques to image set anaysis problems.</p>
